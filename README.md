# Phone-Directory (BST)
A phone directory maintains a list of names and corresponding phone numbers.
## Available Functions:
- Search: Locate a contact by name or number.
- Delete: Remove a contact from the directory.
- Modify: Update the details of an existing contact.
The directory's information, including names and phone numbers, is stored in a file.

The goal is to implement a phone directory program in C++ using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
